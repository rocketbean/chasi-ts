      <div class="sub-text " >
        Router is an instance of a
        <tag v-bind="{ name: 'ServiceProvider', style: 'is-primary', reference: 'ServiceProvider' }" />
        module, that acts like a module, but is running inside
        Chasi's core process. Router was modularized to extend the flexibility
        of a routing service instead of having a fixed boundary in a
        process that requires flexibility, therefore providing its users with
        extended abstraction and fluidity, while keeping the Router instances isolated
        to each other, yet connected to a single source of dependencies.
        Yep! Users can have multiple router instance, in the registry. Implementing
        different configurations, implying different sets of middlewares, authentication, controllers,
        databases, etc., but still possible to intersect if a dependency is pointed to a
        single source. Routers can also implement different types of modules like, the
        <tag v-bind="{ name: 'CompilerEngine', style: 'is-link', reference: 'CompilerEngine' }" /> which is a different
        <tag v-bind="{ name: 'ServiceProvider', style: 'is-primary', reference: 'ServiceProvider' } " /> module, and is
        mounted in the default Router Instance Chasi provides, that is possibly running this page.

        In RouterServiceProvider file, Routers are registered inside the boot method, which is a ServiceProvider method,
        that is being executed before the server(

        event, which is part of Chasi's lifecycle.
        <tag v-bind="{ name: 'ServiceProvider@boot', style: 'is-link', reference: 'ServiceProvider' }" />
        method is mainly for collecting information, before it runs in the registry.
